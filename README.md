# Poshery

Bucket of utility PowerShell scripts.

## Docs

The Docs folder contains online help files for scripts. You do not need to include this folder in a clone.

## Standalone

The Standalone folder contains scripts written for usage as files. Dot-sourcing them will not correctly expose their functions.
